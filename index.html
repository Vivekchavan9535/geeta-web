            <p>Swami Vivekananda Says —
                Later on we read what Krishna says, 
                <br>
                “Even those who worship other deities are really worshipping me.” 
                <br>
                It is God incarnate whom man is worshipping.
                <br>
                 Would God be angry if you called Him by the wrong name? He would be no God at all! Can’t you understand that whatever a man has in his own heart is God — even if he worships a stone? What of that![Source]

                Question: How should man worship God?
                <br>
                <br>
                Answer: With faith.</p>
